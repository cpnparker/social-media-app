/**
 * Regression guard for the fixes made after the all-company-message incident.
 * `npx tsx scripts/verify-incident-fixes.ts`
 *
 * Every assertion below is pinned to something that actually happened in one
 * real session, not to a hypothetical. The prompts are the user's own words,
 * typos included, because the typos are part of why the routing behaved as it
 * did — "restructre" matches no keyword list.
 *
 * What this cannot check is the part that matters most: whether a model given
 * the new prompt rules actually declines to name a colleague in a draft. That
 * is behaviour, not code, and it needs a live eval. What it CAN pin is that
 * the rules are present, that the routing lands where intended, and that the
 * three silent-failure paths (registry mutation, blob ownership, context
 * truncation) behave.
